# DiscordKit

The Discord API implementation that powers [Swiftcord](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/Swiftcord)

This implementation has fully functional REST and Gateway
support, but is mainly geared towards human accounts and not bots.

**If you like DiscordKit, please give it a ⭐ star! It helps motivate
me to continue developing it**

## Check out [Swiftcord](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/Swiftcord) for an example of a project that uses DiscordKit!
